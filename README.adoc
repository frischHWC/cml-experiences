# CML Experiences

Goal of this repository is to provide some few easy examples of demo to run on CML.

It relies on Data generated previously be Datagen.


## Data Generation

To generate data, there are two ways:

1. Use the script link:gen_data.sh[gen_data.sh] to generate data. You will need to change variables at the top of the script to match your environment. 
    __WARNING: install jq before running the script, example: yum install jq__
    
1. Do it manually by following below instructions to generate data using swagger (or directly API) of Datagen (a service deployed in your base cluster).


### Weather 

Use Datagen to generate data in _hdfs-parquet_  with following parameters:

- Model file: link:datagen-models/weather-model.json[weather-model]
- Batches: 10
- Rows: 100000
- Threads: 10

Then play weather-model.py file in a CML Session.


### Bank Accounts

Use Datagen to generate data in _hdfs-parquet_ with following parameters:

- Model file: link:datagen-models/bank-account-model.json[bank-account-model]
- Batches: 10
- Rows: 1000000
- Threads: 10

Then play bank-accounts.py file in a CML Session.
